# Screen Dotfiles
Screen is a terminal multiplexer,
meaning that it allows you to run several instances of programs out of one terminal window.
It can also maintain a persistent session, even when you arenâ€™t connected,
so if you set it up on a server, you can connect, start a process, disconnect,
and return to it at a later date.
